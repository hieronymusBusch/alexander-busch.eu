<b> All links to Overleaf Templates </b> <br>

You can copy the files to your own compiler, such as Overleaf. <br>
The documentation is at times messy, sometimes German - it is not perfect (yet)! <br>
I also want to note that these templates are my adaptations of other <br>
templates, which again are probably inspired by previous works. <br>
