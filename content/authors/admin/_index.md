I am preparing for my PhD as pre-doc at UC Berkeley & MIT. Previously, I studied Economics and Sociology at the LSE, Heidelberg University, and Goethe University Frankfurt. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely town situated in the Hessian Kinzig Valley east of Frankfurt. 

My interests are in Microeconomics and Labour Economics - especially education and industrial relations. 

A recent project of mine is to assess whether ''compressing'' education (same content in fewer years) has an impact on labour market outcomes of students. By evaluating a staggered education reform in Germany which reduced schooling by one year but kept the curriculum constant, I find that the compression was successful and did not affect the returns to education. On the other hand, many graduates delayed their labour market entry post-reform. The average job entry age only decreased by 6 months instead of a full year. This explains the otherwise puzzling result of a constant wage penalty in the within-graduation cohort comparison (-12%), but a constant wage premium in the within-birth cohort comparison (+10%). Please reach out for a first draft of the paper! 

My other research concerns the ''returns'' to strikes and codetermination. 

Jointly with Chantal Pezold, I run an online reading group on labour market institutions for PhD students and post-docs. While we keep this group at a limited size to allow for productive discussions, feel free to reach out if you are interested in joining. 

Outside academia, I had the privilege to work on evidence-based policy advocacy at the German Ministry of Finance, ver.di (united services trade union), and the German and Hessian Parliaments. I am head of climate policy at Fiscal Future, a Berlin-based think tank for progressive fiscal policy.
