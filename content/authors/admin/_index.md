I am currently preparing for my PhD as pre-doc at UC Berkeley & IZA Bonn. Previously, I studied Economics and Sociology at LSE, Heidelberg University, and Goethe University Frankfurt. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely town situated in the Hessian Kinzig Valley east of Frankfurt. 

My interests are in Microeconomics and Labour Economics - especially education, industrial relations, and corporate governance. For example, my master thesis centres on whether ''compressing'' education (same content in fewer years) has an impact on labour market outcomes of students. 

Outside academia, I had the privilege to work on evidence-based policy advocacy at the German Ministry of Finance, ver.di (united services trade union), and the German and Hessian Parliaments.
