I am currently preparing for a PhD in economics as pre-doc at IZA Bonn and incoming visiting student researcher at UC Berkeley. Previously, I studied Economics and Sociology at LSE, Heidelberg University, and Goethe University Frankfurt. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely old town situated in the Hessian Kinzig Valley east of Frankfurt. 

My interests are in the fields of Public and Labour Economics, especially inequality and labour market institutions such as trade unions, work councils, and schools. I have written my two bachelor theses on the regional inequalities of the pandemic and welfare policy. My master thesis centered on the question of whether ''compressing'' education (same content in fewer years) has an impact on labour market outcomes of students. Since 2019, I have worked as research and teaching assistant on a range of quantitative projects which may broadly be summarised under the umbrella term of ''applied microeconomics'' (e.g. in gender and environmental economics, demography). 

Outside academia, I had the privilege to work on evidence-based policy design as intern in the German Ministry of Finance, and the German and Hessian Parliaments. 

In my free time, I enjoy music festivals, playing and watching football, reading, and supporting people in their efforts to democratise their work places.
