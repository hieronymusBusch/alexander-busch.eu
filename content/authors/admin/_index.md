I am a PhD student at the Institute for Work and Employment Research of MIT Sloan. Previously, I worked as a pre-doc at UC Berkeley/MIT/IZA Bonn and studied Economics and Sociology at the LSE, Heidelberg University, and Goethe University Frankfurt. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely town east of Frankfurt, Germany. 

My research assesses how institutions such as trade unions and employer associations shape the labour market. In current projects I evaluate the economic impact of strikes, worker co-management, and sectoral bargaining. 

Please cc both e-mail addresses and note that I am on the US east coast if you require a timely response.
