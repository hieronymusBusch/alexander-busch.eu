I am pursuing the M.Sc. in Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Previously, I studied Economics and Sociology at Heidelberg University. I grew up in Gelnhausen, a lovely old town situated in the Hessian Kinzig Valley east of Frankfurt. 

My interests are in the fields of Public and Labour Economics, such as gender and income inequality and the policies associated with the fights against them. I have written my two bachelor theses on the regional inequalities within the pandemic and welfare policy. Since 2019, I have worked as research and teaching assistant on a range of quantitative projects of which the majority may broadly be summarised under the umbrella term of ''applied microeconomics'' (e.g. gender and environmental economics, demography). 

Outside academia, I had the privilege to see how academic advise is interpreted and implemented by policy makers in the German Parliament and Ministry of Finance. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching football, learning languages, and support people to unionise.
